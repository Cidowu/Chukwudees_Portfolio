#### This is my first data science project with python

# Project 1: Housing in Brazil - Project Overview
* Analyzed over 22000 property data from Brazil
* Cleaned data and removed all empty rows
* Carried out EDA to have a quick understanding of the factors affecting property prices
* Carried out Data visualization to visualize data effectively
* Carried out Regression analysis to understand the relationship between area per sq meter and price 


# Code and Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, plotly
* Traning: WQU


# Data Cleaning
* Dropped all null values (It was a small proportion, and had little effect on the overall analysis)
* Parsed "lat-lon" and created two different columns "lat", "lon"
* Created "state' column 
* Created "price_usd" column by converting "price_brl" to USD using exchange rates
