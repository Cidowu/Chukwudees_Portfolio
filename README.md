# Chukwudees_Portfolio
#### This is my first data science project with python

# [Project 1: Housing in Brazil - Project Overview](https://github.com/Cidowu/Chukwudees_Portfolio) 
* Analyzed over 22000 property data from Brazil
* Cleaned messy data and combined different datasets
* Carried out EDA to have a quick understanding of the factors affecting property prices
* Carried out Data visualization to visualize data effectively
* Carried out Regression analysis to understand the relationship between area per sq meter and price


# [Code and Resources Used](https://github.com/Cidowu/Chukwudees_Portfolio)
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, plotly
* Traning: WQU


# [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Cidowu/Chukwudees_Portfolio)
* Dropped all null values (It was a small proportion, and had little effect on the overall analysis)
* Parsed "lat-lon" and created two different columns "lat", "lon"
* Created "state' column 
* Created "price_usd" column by converting "price_brl" to USD using exchange rates


# [EDA](https://github.com/Cidowu/Chukwudees_Portfolio)
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. 
Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.
